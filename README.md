## Regression
### Project 1: Insurance charges Prediction

In this TensorFlow regression project, predict insurance charges based on diverse factors such as age, BMI, number of children, smoker status, and region. Implement a robust regression model to analyze the relationships between input features and insurance costs. Utilize TensorFlow's powerful capabilities to train and optimize the model for accurate predictions. Gain insights into the impact of different variables on insurance charges through thorough analysis and visualization.

## Multi-class Classification
### Project 2: Fashion Mnist 

In this project, I leveraged TensorFlow to develop a multi-class classification model for the Fashion MNIST dataset. Using deep learning techniques, the model was trained to accurately categorize images of clothing items into various classes such as shirts, trousers, shoes, and more. The implementation involved constructing a neural network architecture, preprocessing the dataset, training the model on a diverse set of fashion images, and evaluating its performance to achieve high accuracy in classifying unseen fashion items.
